# MachineLearning

This repository is based on the coursework Introduction to Machine Learning in python by Sundeep Rangan (EL-GY6123) I took during Fall 20 semester.

Tools : Scikit Learn, Keras, TensorFlow
The following uploads are the homeworks completed using Google Colaboratory and Jupyter notebook

1. Simple Linear Regression - Boston Housing dataset
2. Multiple Linear Regression - Calibrating Robot Dynamics
3. Model Order Selection - Neural Decoding of Motor Cortex signals
4. LASSO and Ridge Regularization - EEG signals for source localization
5. Logistic Regression - Genetic analysis of Down's syndrome in mice
6. Non Linear Optimization - Non Linear Least Squares (NLLS) for Material Modelling
7. Support Vector Machines - Extended EMNIST dataset with letters and numbers
8. Neural Networks - Music Instrument classification
9. Convolutional and Deep Networks - Transfer Learning with pre-trained network (VGG16/Xception)
10. Principal Component Analysis - Hyper-parameter optimization for classification of wine,
                                  Low Rank Approximation for movie recommendation system
